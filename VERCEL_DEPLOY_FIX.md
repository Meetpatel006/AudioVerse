# Authentication Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Issue Summary
Some protected routes were failing in the Vercel deployment with "User not authenticated" errors. The server-side rendering was attempting to access the user ID from headers set by the middleware, but this was failing in production.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated middleware.ts**:
   - Simplified middleware to only handle API authentication
   - Let Next.js handle page authentication through server components
   - Removed header-based authentication approach

2. **Updated Protected Routes**:
   - Modified protected routes to follow the same pattern as text-to-speech
   - Using direct cookie access with Next.js cookies() API
   - Each protected route now handles its own authentication check

3. **Fixed Protected Routes**:
   - Updated `/creative-platform/speech-synthesis/speech-to-speech/page.tsx`
   - Updated `/creative-platform/sound-effects/generate/page.tsx`
   - Both now use the same server-side authentication pattern as text-to-speech

## Deployment Instructions

1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Push to the branch that Vercel is configured to deploy
3. Verify that all routes are working properly after deployment

## Testing Locally

Before deploying, you can test these changes locally by:
1. Running `npm run build` to verify there are no build errors
2. Running `npm start` to test the production build locally
3. Testing all the routes that were previously failing

If everything works locally, it should work on Vercel as well.
